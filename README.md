# About

This is a rag model that uses ollama and the official nba season playing rules 
to work as a RAG model that can be used to know the nba rules and guidelines
the main premise of this project is for fans of the nba who would want to learn how to rules work
also people who would want to venture into becoming an nba referee but doesn't want to go through the hassle of reading this document 

## Future updates

* create a multimodal version of this that can show images of the ref rules
* convert it to a streamlit site
